    "Procedural generation: maze floors can now optionally use Wilson\u2019s algorithm (loop-erased random walks) to build a uniform spanning tree before the existing braiding/chamber pass; adds Maze telemetry and #mapstats line (MAZEGEN | WILSON / ...)."

  "description": "Adds a new Maze procgen variant powered by Wilson\u2019s algorithm (loop-erased random walks) to generate a uniform spanning tree over the maze cell grid. The generator then applies the existing wall-break braiding, chamber carving, BFS stairs placement, and strategic corridor door placement. Exposes non-serialized Dungeon telemetry (mazeAlgorithm + Wilson stats) and prints MAZEGEN lines in #mapstats; includes a subtle arrival hint.",
