  "summary": [
    "Added a new advanced vault prefab: \"vault suites\" partition some vault rooms into multiple chambers with interior walls and internal doors (LOS breaks + staged fights).",
    "Vault suites still place at least one obstacle tile (pillars/chasm/boulders) and request a guaranteed bonus loot cache deep in the final chamber; deeper floors may request a second cache.",
    "Added a unit test that scans seeds and asserts at least one vault suite appears (interior wall tiles + interior closed doors)."
