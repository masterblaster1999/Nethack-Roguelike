  "summary": [
    "Fixed MSVC compilation errors in heightfield terrain decoration by correcting the ridge pillar spacing check (removed an accidental reference to an out-of-scope variable).",
    "Added a deterministic SpatialHashGrid2D helper for fast minimum-distance placement checks and applied it to ridge pillar and scree cluster center selection.",
    "Removed now-unused separation-squared locals that became redundant after the spatial hash refactor."

    "The ridge pillar + scree cluster placement rules remain unchanged (still uses strict distSq < r*r), but the new implementation is harder to break and scales better on larger maps."
