  "notes": "Round 156 focuses on UX clarity + build stability. A MSVC compile break in the inventory panel was caused by calling artifactPowerTag() with a Power enum instead of an Item; this is now corrected to powerTag(). In parallel, the inventory info panel now surfaces Ego and Artifact special properties directly for melee/ranged weapons, armor, rings, and wands, and adds an at-a-glance TRAITS line that summarizes your currently equipped proc keywords (e.g., BURN/POISON/DAZE/WARD/VITALITY).",
