  "description": "Adds POTION OF HALLUCINATION + a new Hallucination timed effect. While hallucinating, monster/item sprites are re-mapped into a deterministic kaleidoscope of other kinds (map + inventory), accompanied by rare flavor messages. Blessed potions shorten the trip and grant brief Vision; cursed potions extend it and add Confusion. Also teaches POTION OF CLARITY to cure hallucinations.",
