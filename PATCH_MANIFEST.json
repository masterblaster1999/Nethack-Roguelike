  "summary": [
    "Fixed MSVC build errors in monster AI procedural abilities: corrected dungeon member usage, FOV mask typing, and map dimension references; also reused a scratch FOV mask to reduce per-cast allocations when seeding hazard fields.",
    "Cleaned up MSVC warnings: eliminated shadowing of Game members (`rng`, `fx`) and debug locals (`total`, `pct`, `p`), removed/annotated unused dungeon-generator variables/parameters, and corrected `pushFxParticle` call argument ordering to avoid float->int conversions."
