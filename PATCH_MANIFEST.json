  "summary": [
    "Procedural annex micro-dungeons: some floors now carve a larger optional side-area (mini-maze or mini-cavern) into solid rock behind a door, adding fresh exploration variety without ever gating stairs progression.",
    "Annex doors can be secret or locked; the annex interior is generated on a local sub-grid (recursive-backtracker perfect maze or cellular-automata cavern) and stamped into the dungeon as a single-entrance pocket with deep chest caches.",
    "New floor-entry hint when an annex exists: \"YOU HEAR A HOLLOW ECHO BEHIND THE STONE.\""
