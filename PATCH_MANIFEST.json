  "summary": [
    "Added kick-rolled boulders: kicking a boulder can now set it rolling like a low-momentum rolling-boulder trap, crushing entities in its path.",
    "Refactored rolling-boulder trap simulation into a shared helper (rollBoulderFrom) so traps and kicked boulders use consistent movement, door interactions, and collision rules.",
    "Chasm impacts now consistently describe forming a rough bridge when a boulder fills a chasm tile."

  "notes": [
    "Kicked boulders reuse the same collision logic as boulder traps: they can smash doors (chance scales with Might/level), crush and scatter entities, and fill chasms into rough bridges.",
    "The shared rollBoulderFrom helper also supports trap-style spawning (including an initial on-tile crush) to keep rolling-boulder behavior centralized and easier to extend.",
    "Boulder roll damage includes a momentum-based bonus that decays as the boulder travels, so long rolls are less lethal than point-blank kicks."
