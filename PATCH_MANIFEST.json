  "summary": [
    "Fixed MSVC build break in render.cpp: centralized fitToChars helpers so LOOK/targeting HUD text no longer references an out-of-scope lambda.",
    "Targeting and LOOK bottom HUD labels now use a compact two-line hint bar plus a middle-ellipsis fitter, keeping both context and control hints visible on narrow windows.",
    "Removed MSVC C4244 warnings by type-correcting SDL_SetRenderDrawColor arguments (Uint8) and by using uint8_t{0} for byte-grid fills/initialization in dungeon/spawn generation."
