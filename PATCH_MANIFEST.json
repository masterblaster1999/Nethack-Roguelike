Adds a centralized SDL include wrapper (SDL_MAIN_HANDLED, SDL_SetMainReady), implements missing Renderer::drawItemIcon for the chest overlay, fixes CLI optional parsing for --record-hash-interval, and fixes KeyBinds chord string formatting. Also silences two MSVC warnings (shadowed 'acted', constant conditional).",
