    "Added a new trap type: Poison Gas \u2014 creates a persistent toxic cloud that poisons entities standing in it.",
    "Poison gas is stored per-level, diffuses/decays over time, is rendered on the map, and is serialized in save files (SAVE_VERSION bumped to 36).",
    "Updated trap spawning tables (doors, caches, labs, chests), UI look text, automove trap penalties, and added unit tests (trap behavior + save/load roundtrip)."
