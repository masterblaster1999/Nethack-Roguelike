  "summary": [
    "Add a new procedural sprite generator for isometric 2.5D open-door doorway frames (square sprite with stone faces + passable opening shading).",
    "Generate and cache open-door frame variants lazily alongside other isometric terrain assets (doorBlockOpenVarIso).",
    "Render DoorOpen tiles using the new 2.5D doorway frames in ViewMode::Isometric (and include them as occluders/shadow casters for better depth cues)."

  "notes": [
    "Open doors are passable but still represent architectural wall openings; in isometric view they now render as a 2.5D doorway frame so the map reads with more vertical depth.",
    "When doorway frames are available, the renderer suppresses the flat projected floor overlay for DoorOpen to avoid visual clutter/double-drawing."
