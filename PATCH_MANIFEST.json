    "Added `bonusItemSpawns`: a new procgen hint channel for guaranteed setpiece ground-item drops (keys/lockpicks/etc.), applied after generic room loot to avoid collisions and counted toward key/lockpick guarantees.",
    "Extended the vault prefab glyph set with `K` (spawn a key) and `R` (spawn a lockpick), enabling deterministic lock-and-key micro-puzzles and tool caches.",
    "Added new vault prefabs (Keyed Inner Vault + Secret Tools Cache) and enhanced dead-end stash closets to sometimes drop a small tools/gold find when no chest rolls."

  "description": "Expands dungeon procedural generation with a small but powerful new capability: setpieces can now request exact ground-item spawns via `bonusItemSpawns`, letting procedural features reliably place keys/lockpicks/rewards outside of rooms. The vault prefab system gained `K`/`R` item glyphs and new prefabs that use them for a self-contained keyed inner-vault micro-puzzle and a secret tool cache. Dead-end stash closets also occasionally provide a small utility reward when they do not spawn a chest.",
