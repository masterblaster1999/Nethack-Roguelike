  "description": "Fixes MSVC build errors introduced by the LOOK-mode sound/hearing overlays: the code referenced an undefined `idx` helper when indexing width*height fields. A shared local grid-index lambda is now defined in Game::lookInfoText(), and the overlay logic tightens vector size checks before indexing.",
