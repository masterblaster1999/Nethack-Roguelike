  "description": "Replaces fixed handcrafted set-piece floors with the standard procedural pipeline all the way down to depth 25, so every campaign floor is generated via the same generate-and-test procgen meta-pass.",

    "Dungeon::generate no longer hard-switches to bespoke Sanctum/Labyrinth/Sokoban/Rogue layouts; the run uses the procedural generator for depths 1..DUNGEON_MAX_DEPTH.",
    "Removed special-depth omen/callout text tied to the old handcrafted set-pieces.",
    "Procedural map sizing now applies to depth==maxDepth as well (the bottom floor participates in the same sizing curve)."
