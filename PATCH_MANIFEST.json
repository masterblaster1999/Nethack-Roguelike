  "summary": [
    "Main dungeon level generation (depth 1\u201325) now uses a deterministic per-level seed derived from the run seed + level identity, so floors generate consistently and do not perturb the gameplay RNG stream (matching Infinite World behavior).",
    "Augury preview now seeds its simulation from the same per-level seed, making the vision stable/accurate regardless of other RNG-consuming actions before descending.",
    "The final Sanctum (depth 25) is now procedurally varied: randomized corner room assignments, sanctum dimensions/offset, door wall + moat bridges, and arena pillar scatter while preserving Treasure/Shrine room metadata for boss/objective spawning."
