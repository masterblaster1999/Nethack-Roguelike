    "Added a NetHack-style COUNT prefix for repeatable actions: type digits then move/wait/search/evade/stairs to auto-repeat at the configured auto-step delay.",
    "HUD now shows COUNT (pending) and REPEAT (active) indicators, plus help overlay docs.",
    "ESC/CANCEL now correctly closes chest/spells/codex/discoveries/scores overlays (not just inventory/help/etc)."

  "description": "Introduces a deterministic per-level wind drift model for physical projectiles (arrows, rocks, torches). Shots are biased by the dungeon\u2019s wind direction/strength; the ranged targeting HUD now shows WIND/DRIFT and suppresses misleading hit chances when drift pushes the projectile line away from the aimed tile.",

  "notes": [
    "Add Game::windAdjustShot(): a small deterministic model that biases physical projectile targets (arrows/rocks/torches) based on per-level wind direction/strength and shot distance.",
    "Apply wind drift in combat.cpp for ranged attacks so both player and monsters are affected consistently.",
    "Update ranged targeting preview (src/game_targeting.cpp) to show WIND/DRIFT and display HIT 0% when drift makes the aimed tile fall off the actual projectile line."
