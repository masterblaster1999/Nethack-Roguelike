  "summary": [
    "Vault generation now prefers partition-vaults: it splits an existing normal room with a wall line and places a single locked door into that partition, creating a sealed vault alcove without requiring large solid-wall blocks.",
    "Falls back to the original wall-carve vault method when no suitable room can be partitioned (e.g., certain maze/cavern layouts).",
    "Added a regression test that scans seeds and asserts at least one vault entrance is a partition-style locked door embedded in a wall line."
