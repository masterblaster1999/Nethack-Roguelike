    "Minimap zoom: [ / ] while the minimap is open to scale the minimap tile size (also persisted via minimap_zoom in settings).",
    "Minimap info: adds a third info line that shows the look-style description of the tile under the minimap cursor (truncated to fit).",
    "Minimap traps: discovered traps now show as colored pips on the minimap (faded in fog-of-war).",
    "Sneak mode stealth: monsters have a reduced visual detection range while you are sneaking (with penalties for heavy armor/encumbrance and partial resistance for keen-sensed monsters).",
    "Sneak mode scent: sneaking leaves a weaker scent trail, making smell-capable monsters less reliable trackers (heavy armor/encumbrance reduce the benefit).",
    "Sneak mode tradeoffs: sneaking is now slightly slower via occasional extra monster turns; door open/close/lock/pick interactions are also quieter while sneaking.",
    "Determinism/testing: include sneakMode_ in determinismHash() and add a save/load regression test that preserves sneak state."
