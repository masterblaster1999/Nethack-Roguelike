    "Added a corridor-braiding post-pass: it searches from corridor dead-ends through solid wall and carves short connecting tunnels to other corridors, creating extra loops and reducing mandatory backtracking.",
    "The braiding pass is conservative: it avoids rooms, doors, stairs, and chasm edges, and only digs through Wall tiles in solid stone.",
    "Integrated braiding before the existing terrain sculpt pass so newly dug tunnels also get edge-sculpting/roughening.",
    "Exposed Dungeon::corridorBraidCount as a lightweight per-floor debug/telemetry counter (tunnels carved)."
