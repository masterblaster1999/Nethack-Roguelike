  "summary": [
    "Procedural VTuber holo card editions: each VTUBER HOLOCARD now deterministically rolls an edition (STANDARD/FOIL/ALT/SIGNED/COLLAB) derived from the item sprite seed.",
    "New card art variants: FOIL increases holo sheen, ALT adds a tiny starfield accent, SIGNED adds an autograph scribble, and COLLAB renders two mini portraits with split accent edges.",
    "UI polish: item names, LOOK hints, and #vtubers roster now surface card editions (and collab partner/serial when applicable).",
    "Economy: VTuber merch sell value now scales procedurally by rarity, card edition, and a coarse follower band (still with small deterministic shop variance)."
