    "Fixed MSVC build errors/warnings in renderer + procedural spritegen: exposed Renderer::FRAMES publicly for non-member flipbook consumers, declared resampleSpriteToSize() in spritegen.hpp, added rand01(uint32_t) hash-to-float helper, corrected pointInIsoDiamond() argument ordering, and added ScoreEntry.conducts (recorded + persisted in scores CSV)."
